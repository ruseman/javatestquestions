Questions for JavaTest

About
-
This repository is meant to store the questions used by [JavaTest](https://github.com/Commador/JavaTest).  
  
These questions are stored in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format, and can be easily seen [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Commador/JavaTestQuestions/master/questions.json).

The format is simple enough.  The root object has a version value, and an array of questions.  Each question has a prompt, and 4 possible answers, the first of which is always correct.
